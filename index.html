                        <p> Snapdragon or Flap-dragon — A game of snatching raisins or nuts from burning brandy.

Use it In a sentence: We played flap-dragon because we needed an excuse to play with fire indoors.</p>

                         <h2>FUN WITH BOOKS</h2>
                        <p> I’m currently reading a romance novel about an eternal highlander and a researcher who has visions. </p>
                     <h2>BAD AT JOKES</h2>
                        <p> I never have a joke on hand. I’m better in the moment with a zinger, but not when it comes to regurgitating jokes on-demand. I want to have at least a few in my pocket for the future. 
Here is one written by Grok: <p>

Why are writers always cold?
Because they're surrounded by drafts!

                        <p>I am eternally grateful for terrible experiences. Nothing like it can more easily solidify one’s core values. Nothing like it can make a moment of rest more peaceful. I don’t think forgiveness is something you can do once. It feels more like a daily exercise. I’m working on forgiving myself these days. I forgive myself. I forgive others. If I write it enough, one day I may believe it. </p>

<h2>WORKOUT & HEALTH</h2>
                        <p>I almost did a chin up last week! Very big deal for me. Pull ups/chin ups are not typically easy for women unless you seriously commit to training. You have to try almost every other day and also strengthen your back muscles sufficiently. For me, I have a strong build already. Cutting, reducing overall weight usually results in quicker time to pull up / chin up for me. I just started dieting in December, so it’s only been a month or so. Reduced/almost entirely cut out empty calories from alcohol is usually all it takes. Imagine I’ll get stricter soon and go paleo-ish. That’s a pretty quick path to skinny for me usually too. 

<p>Workout/fitness goals for the short-term: </p>
<ul>
<li>See if the sauna and I agree</li>
<li>Add cardio</li>
<li>Continue volume weight training (ten sets of 4-5 exercises, 10 reps each) Recovery day - 5x10. In a hurry days 5 sets x 20 reps</li>
<li>Try new movements - strengthen back for pull ups</li>
<li>For the love of God, please eat more protein</li>
</ul>

                        <p>“I am the gym.”</p><p> </p>
                        <p> I “wrote” this affirmation outside the courthouse in Oxford. I was doing push-ups to mentally prepare for what I was about to go into. A man yelled at me from across the street and pointed at a building. “There’s a gym right there.” I replied, “I am the gym.”<p>
                    <h2>WORDS, WORDS, WORDS</h2>
                      
                        <p>I’d upload the picture for these words, but it seems to have gone missing. 
It’s something that stuck in my brain because I “wrote” it down by carving it into my desk:<p>
<i>
Given enough time
The truth will be revealed
Or forcibly revealed
By those unwilling to accept the status quo</i><p>
